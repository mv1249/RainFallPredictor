# RainFallPredictor
Based on previously collected data on parameters like wind speed,gust speed etc..here i've designed an Machine Learning Model which predicts whether it's going to rain tomorrow or not
this is a machine learning model which is trained on parameters like windspeed,gust speed etc and the model is trained on these features to predict whether it's going to rain tomorrow or not
i've used bootstarp and flask server as the front end and the algorithm used is Random Forest which works as the backend

here's the link of the application---->  https://rainfallpredictor.herokuapp.com/
